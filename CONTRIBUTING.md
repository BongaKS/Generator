### Setting Up Development Environment

## # Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## # Installation Steps

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
   cd REPOSITORY-NAME
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create local configuration files:
   ```bash

   # If you need to customize sites.yml or values.yml for development
   cp sites.yml sites.local.yml
   cp values.yml values.local.yml
   ```

## # Running the Application

```bash
node app.js
```

### Code Style and Standards

## # JavaScript

- We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and complex code blocks

## # YAML Files

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep files organized with clear section comments
- Follow consistent naming conventions for keys

## # Templates

- The project uses Jinja2-style templates (`.j2` extension)
- Maintain consistent indentation within template files
- Document any non-obvious template variables at the top of the file

## # General Guidelines

- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Avoid commented-out code in submissions

### Testing Procedures

Before submitting your changes, please ensure:

1. The application runs without errors:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

2. Any template changes produce valid output:
   ```bash

   # If you've modified templates, verify the generated output is valid

   # For nginx templates, consider using nginx -t to test configuration validity
   ```

3. Your changes don't break existing functionality:
   - Test with different configuration values in sites.yml and values.yml
   - Verify error handling works as expected

### Pull Request Process

1. **Branch Naming**:
   - Use descriptive branch names: `feature/description`, `bugfix/issue-number`, or `docs/what-changed`

2. **Before Submitting**:
   - Ensure your code follows our style guidelines
   - Update documentation if you're changing functionality
   - Make sure all tests pass

3. **Creating a Pull Request**:
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Reference any related issues using #issue-number
   - Provide a clear description of the changes and their purpose
   - Include screenshots for UI changes if applicable

4. **Review Process**:
   - A maintainer will review your PR
   - Address any requested changes promptly
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge your contribution
